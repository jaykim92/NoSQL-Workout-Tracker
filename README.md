# NoSQL-Workout-Tracker

## Description
This app allows users to track their workouts throughout the week. Users can create new workouts or continue previous workouts which will create new documents within a collection or push to an array within a document respectively. The dashboard allows for the user to see the total amount of weights lifted throughout the week.
